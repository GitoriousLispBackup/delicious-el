	* delicioapi.el (delicious-api-html): Fixed a
	parentheses-oops. Added code to retrieve and return the HTML list
	from the DELICIOUS-API-BUFFER after contacting the server. I'm
	doing this in a very primitive way, but it seems to work so
	far. Function is not yet documented.

	HTML feed.

	between words in the buffer and words in your tags list.

	list of unique words. Used to suggest tags.
