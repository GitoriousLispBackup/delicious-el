* Overview

This is a complete set of functions for interacting with the REST API at
http://del.icio.us, a "social bookmarking" project.  None of these are
interactive commands. There is a separate program, `delicious.el', which
includes the interactive commands that put these functions to work in various
ways. These functions are provided separately to make it convenient for people
to write their own front-end interactive commands.

The API does go through frequent changes; I've made an effort here to structure
things so that these changes can easily be accommodated. That's part of why
some things are done in separate functions that could probably be done together
in one.

del.icio.us was written and is maintained by Joshua Shachter.

Information about the API is at http://del.icio.us/doc/api.

* Getting Started

To use these functions, you will need to put something like the following in
your `.emacs'.

(setq delicious-api-user "johnsu01"
delicious-api-password "mypassword"
delicious-api-from "john@wjsullivan.net")

There are some other options as well, but these are the variables that you have
to set for the program to work. I suggest using your e-mail address in
`delicious-api-from', because it is a polite thing to do. That way if your
programs ever start doing anything bonkers, del.icio.us will be able to contact
you and let you know of the problem.

Speaking of programs and bonkers, del.icio.us has requested that you limit your
hits to the API to an extent. Please read the documentation for it and keep up
with the restrictions. In particular, it is requested that you do not do
anything that will trigger one hit to del.icio.us for every hit to your web
site.

Depending on the speed of your connection and of the del.icio.us server, you
might want to use a higher number for `delicious-api-timeout'. The default is
60 seconds.

people are interested, perhaps we will open an area at
